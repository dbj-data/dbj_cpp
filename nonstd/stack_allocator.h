/*
 NOTE:

 stack allocator is very fast and very dangerous and has very limited
 number of uses cases where it can be used.

 Basically it is fast because it does not use heap at all. It will exit() if
 some container using it asks beyond avaialbe stack space.

 It does not throw exceptions.
 It does not free what was taken.
 On stack exhaustion your app will very likely just vanish. Especially in a release mode.

 Ok, what's the point then?

 The point is you want a std lib container API + you know how large it will be
 + you know it will not grow over certain limit.  For example vector<char> is
 one very fast char buffer and has familiar and convenient API

 using namespace dbj::alloc ;
 std::vector<char, stack_allocator< char > > my_buffer( 1024, '+') ;

 Above is very fast anyway, but with stack allocator it is instant.
 Ok, says you, but why not just using:

 char my_buffer[1024] { 0 };

 Because you might use the libraries which do require std::vector, or std::string, etc..
 Also do not forget there are project which are forbidden to use heap!
 If you place such a vector in a global space it will stay as long as the app stays.
