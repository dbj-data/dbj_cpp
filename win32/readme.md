WIn32 depending parts are here. This is presumably C11/17 code as WIN32 is an undefined almost C98 API

dbj++ is not a lib, unless there are *.c files, like in here you need to include in your builds too.
Why do we use *.c files? Well, mainly because that saves us from a polution #include <windows.h> does.

Few excellent WIN32 utils have beem nicked from https://github.com/floooh/sokol . License has been respected to the best of my knowledge.
